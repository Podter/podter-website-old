Everytime when I use Windows, The biggest thing I missed is ZSH with Oh My Zsh.
I tried to use PowerShell or CMD, but it's not as good as ZSH.

So I decided to make it better and feel like I'm using ZSH.

## What do I need from a terminal?

These are all the capabilities I need from a terminal:

- Jazzy colors
- Integration like git, nvm, etc
- Familiarity with ZSH
- Autocompletion for commands and files
- sudo command

## Let's get started

### Chocolatey (optional)

Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows. Like Homebrew for macOS or `apt` for Debian based distros.

This is optional but it will help installing software from terminal easily. You can follow their [documentation](https://chocolatey.org/install) to install it.

### PowerShell 7

First, we need to install PowerShell 7. I'm going to download it from their [website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell). Or you can install it using Chocolatey.

```powershell
choco install powershell-core
```

We don't use Windows PowerShell (The pre-installed one) because it doesn't support some features we need.

For who confused what's difference between Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core 7, you can check out this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqHfuaF2EiY).

### Nerd Fonts

Nerd Fonts is a font that supports icons. We need this font to make our terminal look better. Choose your favorite font from their [website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). I choose `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font` and I'm going to install it using Chocolatey.

```powershell
choco install jetbrainsmononf
```

### Windows Terminal

Windows Terminal is a terminal emulator for Windows. I'm going to install from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701). But you can also install it using Chocolatey.

```powershell
choco install microsoft-windows-terminal
```

Open Windows terminal and then set default profile to PowerShell 7:

1. Settings (That down arrow in the top bar)
2. Set Default Profile as "PowerShell" (the black icon, not the blue Windows PowerShell one)

Also don't forget to set the fonts:

1. Settings
2. Profiles (left menu)
3. PowerShell (or Defaults if you want to change globally)
4. Appearance
5. Font face
6. Select the installed Nerd font, I choose `JetBrainsMono NF`

You can change the color scheme too.

### Oh My Posh

Oh My Posh is a theme engine for PowerShell. It's like Oh My Zsh for ZSH. You can follow their [installation guide](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows) to install it. But I'm going install it using Chocolatey.

```powershell
choco install oh-my-posh
```

After installing, we need to create PowerShell profile. The PowerShell profile is same as `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`. You can provide initial commands, aliases, etc.

You can create it by running this command:

```pwsh
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -ItemType File -Force
```

The file should be located at `~\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.

Open the profile using your text editor.

```pwsh
# Open in VS Code
code $PROFILE

# Or open in Notepad
notepad $PROFILE
```

And set Oh My Posh as the default shell. Put this inside the profile file so that every time you open the terminal, it loads Oh My Posh.

```pwsh
oh-my-posh init pwsh | Invoke-Expression
```

To set custom theme, you need to change the `--config` option of the `oh-my-posh init` command. For example:

```pwsh
# Load amro theme
oh-my-posh init --config amro pwsh | Invoke-Expression

# Load from file
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config 'C:/Users/Posh/jandedobbeleer.omp.json' | Invoke-Expression

# Load from URL
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/jandedobbeleer.omp.json' | Invoke-Expression
```

You can find more themes on theme [documentation](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes). Or learn more about customizing Oh My Posh on customize [documentation](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/customize).

You can download my modified version of `montys` theme from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/Podter/59f8874dcec39b706fd46ad1049daf2f). Or import from URL directly:

```pwsh
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config 'https://gist.github.com/Podter/59f8874dcec39b706fd46ad1049daf2f/raw/7cfe4e98eb81ecf80519f8de0a9ae4c1f9483025/montys.omp.json' | Invoke-Expression
```

### lsd

<Image

lsd is a `ls` command with colors and icons. You can follow the installation guide on their [GitHub readme](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd#installation). I'm going to compile manually but you can install it using Chocolatey.

```powershell
choco install lsd
```

And then replace the PowerShell's default `ls` command with `lsd`:

```pwsh
Set-Alias ls lsd
```

You can also add some aliases for `ls` command:

```pwsh
function l { lsd -l $args }
function la { lsd -a $args }
function lla { lsd -la $args }
function lt { lsd --tree $args }
```

These will add `l`, `la`, `lla`, and `lt` aliases for `ls` command.

### gsudo

gsudo is a sudo command for Windows. This will allow us to run commands with elevated privileges. It's like `sudo` for Linux. You can the follow the installation guide on their [documentation](https://gerardog.github.io/gsudo/docs/install). I'm going to install it using Chocolatey.

```powershell
choco install gsudo
```

And `sudo` command should be available now.

```pwsh
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
sudo pwsh
```

### rm -rf

When I use Linux machine, I always use `rm -rf` command to delete files and alias `rm` to it. But in Windows, we need to use `Remove-Item` command. So I create an alias for it.

```pwsh
Remove-Alias -Name rm # Remove default rm command
function rm { Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $args } # Create new rm command
```

### Autocompletion

Put the following lines in your profile file and you are done.

```pwsh
Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function MenuComplete
Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key UpArrow -Function HistorySearchBackward
Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key DownArrow -Function HistorySearchForward
```

### Alias

You can add some aliases to your profile file. For example:

```pwsh
# Alias `g` to `git`
Set-Alias g git;
```

## Conclusion

That's it. You can now use PowerShell as your daily driver. I hope this guide helps you to make your terminal look better.
